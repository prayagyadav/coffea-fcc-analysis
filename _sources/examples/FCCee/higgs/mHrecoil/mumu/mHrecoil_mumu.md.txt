## Prerequisite setup
Example Analyses are separated into these files:
- `processor_<example_name>.py`
- `runner_<example_name>.py`
- `plotter_<example_name>.py`

A. Clone the [coffea-fcc-analyses](https://github.com/prayagyadav/coffea-fcc-analyses.git) repository.

B. `cd coffea-fcc-analyses`

## ZH Recoil Example:


1. Navigate to example folder
   ```bash
   cd examples/FCCee/higgs/mHrecoil/mumu/
   ```
   
2. Start the singularity shell
   ```bash
   ./shell
   ```
   
3. **A] Local Execution**
   
     Within the shell execute runner_mHrecoil.py with the desired parameters(--executor or -e set to dask by default). The output file would be saved at ./output/FCCee/higgs/mH-recoil/mumu/.
      ```bash
      singularity> python3 runner_mHrecoil.py -e dask
      ```
     One can also choose to split up the processing and results in chunks with the --chunks or -c argument
      ```bash
      singularity> python3 runner_mHrecoil.py -e dask -c 8
      ```
      
     **B] Batch Execution with HTCondor**
   
     Choosing the executor as condor one can generate job and submit files and a master submit file called condor.sh
      ```bash
      singularity> python3 runner_mHrecoil.py -e condor -c 8
      ```
     Now exit the container shell with exit , move to the directory where the files are created(by default Batch) and run condor.sh without getting into the shell
     ```bash
     singularity> exit
     cd Batch
     ./condor.sh
     ```
     
5. Generate plots with plotter_mHrecoil.py (from the singularity shell). The plots would be saved at ./output/FCCee/higgs/mH-recoil/mumu/plots/
   ```bash
   singularity> python3 plotter_mHrecoil.py
   ```
   If the plots are generated in a different folder than ./output/FCCee/higgs/mH-recoil/mumu/ , input it's path with the --input or -i keyword. For example for batch submission, the outputs are saved in Batch directory.
   ```bash
   singularity> python3 plotter_mHrecoil.py -i Batch
   ```
